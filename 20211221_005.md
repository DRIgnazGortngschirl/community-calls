Collected from ETC Discord, Grouped together:

- SHA3
  - Status of sha3
  - I am assuming the majority of miners are on board of sha3
  - Let's say (hypothetical) all things go well with development with sha3 and all miners agree (or a strong %age) as well to switch over, when would this be done?
- Funding
  - Does ETC needs any additional fundings?
  - How much runway does ETCCOOP and Labs actually have?
  - What is better: 2 clients for 2 years or 1 client for 4 years?
- ECIPs
  - Roadmap for 2022 ? 
  - Any interest from the community about ecip-1096 (don't really have to follow 1096 - I don't know that group)?
- Marketing
  - ETC messaging: time to get grandiose?

From brolal 

- Does ETC needs to take a different path to reach that ossify state, like Bitcoin? Is SHA 3 the path in that direction? 
- After the Mystique Hard-Fork, can we relay on the protocol to remain resilient for many years to come, without a solution for funding or hiring development? And what options are being taken in consideration since you agreed to withdraw support for ECIP-1098?
- Did ETC Labs supported the “sweeping mechanism”? And do you think the two teams will agree to a solution in 6 months? 
- Do you think we can find a use case for community fund by the end of 2022?
- Is Gitcoin a viable option to ensure ETC’s innovation future? 
- Are there any other networks weaknesses that you plan to address?
- What threats do you see for ETC and the blockchain industry for the next year? Government intervention, regulations, banks and corporations eager for control? Defi hacks?
