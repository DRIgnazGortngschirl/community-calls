Collected from ETC Discord, Grouped together:

- General thoughts on the state of ETC today? 
- How are ETC Labs / IOHK / ETC Coop doing? 
- Funding
  - Does ETC needs any additional fundings?
  - How much runway do the major teams actually have?
  - What is the "bare minimum" funding needed to keep one client running?
  - What is better: 2 clients for 2 years or 1 client for 4 years?
  - what options are being taken in consideration since you agreed to withdraw support for ECIP-1098?
  - Do you think we can find a use case for community fund by the end of 2022?
  - Is Gitcoin a viable option to ensure ETC’s innovation future?
- Treasury
  - Did ETC Labs support the “sweeping mechanism”? 
  - Do you think all teams will agree to a solution in 6 months? 
  - Will future Treasury proposals be pushed for without the support of all major teams?
- ECIPs
  - Roadmap for 2022 ? 
  - Any interest from the community about ecip-1096 (don't really have to follow 1096 - I don't know that group)?
- SHA3
  - Status of sha3
  - Are the majority of miners on board with sha3?
  - Let's say (hypothetical) all things go well with development with sha3 and all miners agree (or a strong %age) as well to switch over, when would this be done?
  - Does the move to sha3 imply an ossification of the protocol and less forks and modifications afterwards?
- Future Threats
  - What threats do you see for ETC and the blockchain industry for the next year? Government intervention, regulations, banks and corporations eager for control? Defi hacks?
- Marketing
  - Currently ETC coop's marketing narrative is that ETC is "perfectly suitable" and "just like ETH1 but without bloat" (which will come to ETC once popular), but by pushing the angle that ETC has a level of decentralization that cannot be matched by other platforms, making it, unlike ETH and PoS systems, uncapturable and uniquely suitible for global adoption?
