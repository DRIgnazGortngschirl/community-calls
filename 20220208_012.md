## Hard Fork Preamble

- Upcoming Mystique Hard Fork coming ~13th Feb
- Currently ETC Coop has taken charge of this fork including outreach, you can follow bob's twitter (thank you)
- ETC will likely be experiencing hard forks for many years to come, so we wanted to "open source" some of the knowledge that has been accumulated over the years by speaking to a qualified hard fork coordinator, in the hopes that it can help ensure future forks go smoothly
- We are pleased to be joined by one of the most experienced and qualified coordinators out there, Afri, who is veteran and prolific caretaker of various blockchains and testnets. Afri has previously helped coordinated forks on ETC, such as Agharta, and (I believe that series of A-name forks?).

## Questions for Afri

- Firstly, warm welcome, and thank you very much for joining us today to share some knowledge with the ETC community.
- Who is Afri, and how has he been involved with Ethereum & ETC?
- What is the point of hard fork coordination? 
- What is involved in hard fork coordination?
- What are the pitfalls; what kind of things can go wrong when transitioning to a new fork, and how can this be mitigated?
- What kind of network monitoring tools do you use, do you spin up your own nodes to check?
- What happens if there's a chain split; from a coordinator's perspective, what should be done?
- What are the kinds of chain splits that can occur? Accidental, intentional, temporary, permenant, etc...
- If a hard fork results in a chain split, how to resolve things?
- What do you think would happen to applications on a network if there is a permenant chain split (DeFi, NFTs, etc)?
- It seems that part of the role of HF coordinator is to act as a trusted point of contact on behalf of a project, but does this pose any centralization risk that could be exploited? 
- How can projects with no central organizing comittee like ETC coordinate forks in a maximally decentralized way?
- What is your perspective on multiple client implementations, is it helpful or annoying, and would a bitcoin-like approach make coordinating forks easier?
- Thoughts on where ETC is at right now?
- Do you have any thoughts on how The Merge on Ethereum will go, will miners continue the legacy chain?
- What is Afri up to these days? Anything you'd like to shout out?
- SHA3
- Bridges, Chainsafe?
