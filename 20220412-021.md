## Notes

Bob's update 

```
I had seen a couple of questions here about Grayscale and funding.

I can confirm that Grayscale funding of the ETC Cooperative came to a close at the end of March, as expected, and as I signalled was likely many times over the past few months.   So as of April, we are do not have any ongoing funding, but are sitting on $5M+ USD and several hundred thousand dollars worth of ETC.

As an aside for any ETCG holders (and as noted by somebody earlier) the fees for that fund have now dropped from 3% to 2.5%, which brings them in line with most of the other Grayscale funds.   And ETCG, like the other funds, it remains on track for eventual conversion to an ETF.
