## Description

A casual voice chat to discuss ideas for ETC. All are welcome.

The ETC Discord can be joined at https://ethereumclassic.org/discord

Please join us in the #community-calls channel to ask questions or bring up topics.

## Agenda

topic: future public goods, permalinks. Available TLD Domains for these network necessities as we grow into the future. Can we IPFS some of these too? Definitely possible is static pages. cc: @Istora 

ethereumclassic.net network tools coming from this TLD makes sense to me. I'd be happy to dedicate this entire TLD to these type of public good assets for ETC.
