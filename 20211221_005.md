Collected from ETC Discord, Grouped together:

- SHA3
  - Status of sha3
  - I am assuming the majority of miners are on board of sha3
  - Let's say (hypothetical) all things go well with development with sha3 and all miners agree (or a strong %age) as well to switch over, when would this be done?
- Funding
  - Does ETC needs any additional fundings?
  - How much runway does ETCCOOP and Labs actually have?
  - What is better: 2 clients for 2 years or 1 client for 4 years?
- ECIPs
  - Roadmap for 2022 ? 
  - Any interest from the community about ecip-1096 (don't really have to follow 1096 - I don't know that group)?
- Marketing
  - ETC messaging: time to get grandiose?
